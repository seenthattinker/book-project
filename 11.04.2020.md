So this was our first meeting.
We just sort of banged around a few ideas.
The one thing that we resolved is that the structure has to be ascertained at the beginning of the book.
We know that we want to section the book into four 15000 words sections.
We know that we want a 2000 word introduction that gives our general thesis and we know that we want a 2000 word after word that concludes our thesis and proves out our point.
We debated endlessly about the specificity of events as being the delimiter of the four sections of the book,
or whether we go strictly with a time delimited structure the structure must be symmetrical for this enterprise to work.
Repetition is the key to getting information into people's heads.
They call it psychic driving in the programs.
I'm not against either structure.
I could go with an event-driven structure when we talk about a certain day in 1969 and a certain part of San Francisco,
describe the weather and everything that happened that day,
and kind of Forrest Gump the narrative out into the three to five years preceding it and what's being set up for the future.
Or we could just chronologically go through a period of time.
This is the critical decision before us right now.


# The Campaigns


Need a brief etymology of the word campaign.
The Roman definition has to be a part of it.
It might be Latin,
but the root is the most literal.
Maybe we could even give the Latin for Campaigns as the title. 



The campaign's is a manuscript conceived of by an entity known as The Firm.
The Firm at present consists of Bruce MacDonald,
epic journey man,
and Jimmy Jean.
The intent and purpose of the campaigns is to demonstrate that the acquisition of territory and warfare has been the only game on planet earth since the beginning of recorded history.
It further goes on to point out that the modern campaign is not one for physical territory,
although physical territory may result from the game,
but it is primarily concerned with the control of thought and perception in mass groups of people.
This has been called
&mdash;
in a colloquial way
&mdash;
social engineering.
However,
people do not realize how literal the engineering is to the equation.
This has been tuned to a science.
Human populations can be moved overnight with sudden and dramatic events.
Those events might be part of a true unfolding or they might very well be a choreographed live drama.
Modern campaigns from mind control are loosely structured on 10-year plans.
Each 10-year plan has a further goal of moving the group consciousness into a more specific space.
