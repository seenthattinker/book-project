# The Campaigns


Need a brief etymology of the word campaign.
The Roman definition has to be a part of it.
It might be Latin,
but the root is the most literal.
Maybe we could even give the Latin for Campaigns as the title. 



The campaign's is a manuscript conceived of by an entity known as The Firm.
The Firm at present consists of Bruce MacDonald,
epic journey man,
and Jimmy Jean.
The intent and purpose of the campaigns is to demonstrate that the acquisition of territory and warfare has been the only game on planet earth since the beginning of recorded history.
It further goes on to point out that the modern campaign is not one for physical territory,
although physical territory may result from the game,
but it is primarily concerned with the control of thought and perception in mass groups of people.
This has been called
&mdash;
in a colloquial way
&mdash;
social engineering.
However,
people do not realize how literal the engineering is to the equation.
This has been tuned to a science.
Human populations can be moved overnight with sudden and dramatic events.
Those events might be part of a true unfolding or they might very well be a choreographed live drama.
Modern campaigns from mind control are loosely structured on 10-year plans.
Each 10-year plan has a further goal of moving the group consciousness into a more specific space.
