Introduction
======================

The concept of the campaign goes far back in the human record.
What we know for sure is that a campaign is always full of focused intent.
When the Romans were planning a military campaign they would send sewers out along the campaign Trail to plant wheat and other vegetables.
When the army was ready to start marching,
there would be food already grown along the trail.
This is what we mean by *focused intent*.
A long and sustained campaign must be fortified with an unending will and a nearly limitless budget.
Every detail has to be planned out,
like toe Roman army food supply planted along the trail before the campaign.
Like so many things in life,
a campaign comes out of the military.
As a word it's been applied in very many modern contexts now.


The Oxford Dictionary of American English defines it as follows:


#### campaign

>*noun*

Military campaigns are the foundation of our understanding of the world.
You have probably delimited your understanding of history by military campaigns,
whether you realize it or not.
The Hebrews were the victims of campaigns by the Assyrians and the Babylonians.
The Greeks waged campaigns,
the Romans,
the Persians,
the Turks,
the Monguls,
the Chinese,
the Japanese,
the British,
the French,
the Spanish,
the Germans,
and,
of course,
the modern darling,
the bad boy nation of our post Cold War world,
these United States of America.
If there was one thing that defines human history,
one thing more than any other,
it would be war,
and in war you campaign.
You apply unbending will.
You deploy all cunning.
Above all,
you deceive.

If we are understanding the concept of a  campaign correctly,
we can see the entirety of human history as a series of endless campaigns.
It seems as though human beings are hard-wired for a mission statement.
Something always has to be conquered.
There is always an enemy at the door.
What if the very concept of a campaign and warfare specifically is so ingrained in the human being that we can exist without it.
What if a group of social engineers made up of psychiatrists,
behaviorists,
military mind control scientists,
chemists,
magicians and Satanists decided that they could create virtual campaigns.
What if at some point in our history the Basic Instincts of the human being were captured in an endless series of war games that never manifest as war.
What if,
in an effort to take Humanity to a new level of social organization,
they decided the war was against us?
