Introduction
======================


As hard as it might be to believe,
the world has been run by generational and sub-generational programs for decades now.
We are going to attempt one of the boldest theses ever put forward on social engineering.
It is our intent to convince you that sometime in the early twentieth century,
probably the result of planning in the late nineteenth century,
a design was created whereby humanity would go into the first Industrial Age,
and it was agreed that to advance humanity into this technological age,
humanity had to be governed and controlled in a manner by which they were never aware they were being controlled.


The thesis that we're going to put forward is a very simple one
&mdash;
somebody with the power and ability to do so envisioned a world without war.
The very concept of war had reached the limit of its expression.
But war is marked on the flesh and marred into the memory of the human race.
War has been the most consistent practice of the organized human race.
If human technology was to go further the tendency to war had to be quashed.
For that to be effected,
the human race had to be brought into a centralized control.
This means global governance,
and this means warfare waged by tactical police units against small civilian populations.
It's important to keep in mind that our thesis does not preclude violence.
State violence will inevitably increase as nation violence decreases.

As the shape of the future began to take form in the mists of whatever black mirror these people looked into,
one thing above all else was clear
&mdash;
humanity was a liability in its natural form.
How could humanity be helped?
How could humanity be saved from itself?
How could humanity invite and occupy the brave new world to come?
Thus began the pedagogy of the of the state-citizen,
where the teacher is the state and the citizen is the student.
No matter what form of human organization evolved,
collective or individualistic,
the pedagogy was there,
always there like some mother superior waiting to cane your hands.

The great irony of their position is and always has been the most brutal aspects of warfare
&mdash;
perpetual deception,
random killings,
increased money gathering through taxes,
licensing,
and fines for the war effort,
constant confusion and anxiety for the citizen
&mdash;
are always in use because the only way to stop warfare is warfare.
It's for our own good.
It's the pedagogy of the most ascetic order of punishment ever assembled.

There's something inescapable in the religious model.
No matter how much we think we've left it behind,
its footprints are everywhere,
like some nocturnal predator we witness only in the morning by the tracks left in the snow.
It's there even if we can't see it.
The masochistic tendencies evolving in the secular state rival the most Draconian ever employed by the Medieval Vatican.
It's a godless inquisition,
but an inquisition nonetheless,
and what was the inquisition other than a holy campaign?
A campaign is a chapter in the book of war that is the human race.


A campaign is full of focused intent.
When the Romans were planning a military campaign,
they'd send seed planters out along the campaign trail.
When the army was ready to start marching,
there'd be food already grown along the trail.
This is *focused intent*.


A long and sustained campaign must be fortified with an unending will and a nearly limitless budget.
Every detail has to be planned out,
like the Roman army food supply planted along the trail before the campaign.


Military campaigns are the foundation of our understanding of the world.
You've probably sorted your history by military campaigns whether you realize it or not.
The Greeks waged campaigns,
the Romans,
the Persians,
the Turks,
the Mongols,
the Chinese,
the Japanese,
the British,
the French,
the Spanish,
the Germans,
and,
of course,
the modern darling,
the bad boy nation of our post Cold War world,
these United States of America.
If there was one thing that defines human history,
one thing more than any other,
it would be war,
and in war you campaign.
You apply unbending will.
You deploy all cunning.
Above all,
you deceive.

There are no rules in war except prevail.
Few who take up the trade ruminate on not prevailing.
Maybe it's the single mindedness of the war campaign that so transfixes human imagination
&mdash;
the gravity of it all,
the preciousness of life,
the fleetingness of it.
Maybe we can't feel those things unless we risk our lives,
and maybe the way we have collectively agreed to this risk is war.
Could this just be the natural consequence of a sentient being given free will?
Who can say?
The best philosophers of the past three millennia have no clue,
and nobody else really cares.
So war persists as the greatest pastime of the human race,
with nary a generation since the first in the garden passing all its years in peace.


The single greatest act of subterfuge perpetrated upon the Western mind, and more specifically,
the American mind,
is the propagation of the idea that the evolution of Western culture has been natural and organic.
The truth is the last 100 years have been one long military campaign.
The battle line was drawn sometime  around the medical discovery of the unconscious.
It was almost as though the emerging medical science of psychiatry was itself a disclosure of what they planned to do.


We can see the entirety of human history as a series of endless campaigns.
It seems as though human beings are hard-wired for a mission statement.
Something always has to be conquered.
There is always an enemy at the door.
What if the very concept of a campaign and warfare specifically is so ingrained in the human being that we can't exist without it.
What if a group of social engineers made up of psychiatrists,
behaviorists,
military mind control scientists,
chemists,
magicians,
and Satanists decided that they could create virtual campaigns.
What if at some point in our history the basic instincts of the human being were captured in an endless series of war games that never manifest as war.
What if,
in an effort to take humanity to a new level of social organization,
they decided the war was against us?

Of the many definitions of a campaign in the last seventy-five years,
the one most accurate is *advertising campaign.*
You might think that is a little flaccid
&mdash;
after all an advertising campaign could not possibly be as intense as a long,
drawn out,
logistically difficult military campaign,
nor even remotely comparable in gravity to the consequences
&mdash;
but we assure you,
marketing is where a lot of the dirty science got deposited.


The science of the popular mind,
the collective or public mind,
has been in the spotlight for a century.
It has its roots in psychiatry and Edward Bernays was the double nephew of Sigmund Freud.
Born in Vienna,
Austria,
Bernays made his name in America.
He was an unapologetic elitist,
quoted as saying:

>No serious sociologist any longer believes that the voice of the people expresses any divine or specially wise and lofty idea. The voice of the people expresses the mind of the people, and that mind is made up for it by the group leaders in whom it believes and by those persons who understand the manipulation of public opinion. It is composed of inherited prejudices and symbols and cliches and verbal formulas supplied to them by the leaders.


>*Propaganda* by Edward L. Bernays, IG Publishing &copy;  2005



There is a light world and there is a dark world.
The light world is the world of public narrative,
the ideas and beliefs we share in the public space,
no matter how common or exotic
&mdash;
religion,
science,
the paranormal,
extraterrestrials,
culture,
music
&mdash;
literally anything else in the public space.
That is the only criteria to live in the light world.
The dark world is occulted from the light world.
It fulfills its nature perfectly.
It's everything else,
all the little truths about this species,
its biology,
psychology,
chemistry,
literally consciousness itself.
There are opinions on what a human being is,
as many as there are people,
but there is only one truth.
The opinions live in the light world.
The truth lives in the dark world.
It stays in the dark because it's too degrading.

Bernays was in the light world,
but only because he was speaking for the dark world.
It works that way with a lot of things.
People you see in the public were placed there by the dark world to anchor a new understanding.
Sound absurd?
Let's put it another way.
Behind every new movement,
new idea,
new literary movement,
new lifestyle or fashion design,
is the dark world speaking into the light world.
Think about it.
What do you really know behind the *campaign* to make Charles Darwin the father of evolution?
He only stood behind natural selection.
That was his real thesis.
So how did the *concept* of evolution become a part of western thinking,
school curriculum,
and defended public narrative,
with only the most literal of the Abrahamic faiths standing behind god created?
It was a campaign,
you see?
Everything we do is a campaign.
It's hard wired into the human race,
and now it's behavioral tendencies have been capitalized upon by a predacious digital system that seems,
day by day,
a little bit closer to declaring itself a legal person,
whatever that might say about artificial intelligence.
How did it come to this?
How did the western world build its own prison through a concatenated chain of seemingly free will decisions made by a handful of generations that began after the Second World War?
It boggles the mind.
Yet here we are,
on a campaign to chastise and subjugate ourselves,
like an abbey of penitent Franciscans in the Middle Ages?

The great campaigners of history are immortalized
&mdash;
Hitler with his defeat of France in record time,
Napoleon's fracturing of the third alliance against him,
the terrifying sieges of Genghis Khan and the Mongol hordes,
Alexander the Great's multiple conquests in Persia,
Hannibal marching elephants across the Alps,
and,
of course,
Caesar taking Gaul.   
Everybody loves a winner.
When you realize the degree to which our entire species is geared for campaigns,
there seems little else we can do.
What then become the great campaigns of the modern and post-modern worlds?
And whatever this half AI,
digital creep of a post-reality we're living in now,
and we are living post-reality.
Some people might suggest we're saying everybody is insane,
but,
for that to be true,
there would have to be a viable definition of sane.
There is not.




Back in the days of Bernays,
this was largely print,
radio,
and finally television.
Today,
there are dozens of pipelines into the digitally plugged in twenty-first century consumer.
Too many to list here.


The state of the world now with computation and digitization is almost indescribable.
The study of the human brain,
the chemistry and biology,
the behavior,
have been so ingrained in the digital world that it can be seen as little more than the most heinous control system ever created,
a non-stop dopamine dispensary.
This is where we find ourselves in the early twenty-first century,
digital lockdown in a self-created prison of stimulation and reward.
