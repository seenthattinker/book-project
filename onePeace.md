Part One: The Peace Campaign
===================================


Something happened in and around World War II that changed the world we live within.
The way that governments communicate with individual citizens completely changed after the second World War.
It's so distinct when you see it you can almost imagine us walking through a doorway that closed behind us.
We sort of just heard the click and then realized the consequence of our decision.
Propaganda has always been a part of mass communication.
As the media grew so did propaganda.
Just to make sure we're all on the same page,
let's get a clear definition from Merriam-Webster:

#### propaganda 

>noun
>
>
>pro·​pa·​gan·​da
>
>
>1 capitalized : a congregation of the Roman curia having jurisdiction over missionary territories and related institutions
>
>2: the spreading of ideas, information, or rumor for the purpose of helping or injuring an institution, a cause, or a person
>
>3: ideas, facts, or allegations spread deliberately to further one's cause or to damage an opposing cause also : a public action having such an effect


It's really kind of hard to say what propaganda is in the twenty-first century.
With so many independent voices disseminating information to micro audiences there has never been such a fracturing of the information stream in a modern society.
Because of the impossibility of verifying everything said by every disseminator of information,
whether the platform be podcasting,
blogging,
or independently maintained news sites with a very deliberately stated bias,
like Christian news.
We are there for living in an age of pure propaganda.
Micro agendas are inching into the public space.
No longer are we the nation that rallied together in the early part of the twentieth century,
twice no less.
We are now a series of barely interlinked igloos sitting out in the Arctic night for six months,
occasionally crossing paths when,
Necessities require us both to be out and about,
you know,
like foraging for food?
