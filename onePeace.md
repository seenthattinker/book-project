Part One: The Peace Campaign
===================================


Something happened in and around World War II that changed the world we live within.
The way that governments communicate with individual citizens completely changed after the second World War.
It's so distinct when you see it you can almost imagine us walking through a doorway that closed behind us.
We sort of just heard the click and then realized the consequence of our decision.
Propaganda has always been a part of mass communication.
As the media grew so did propaganda.
Just to make sure we're all on the same page,
let's get a clear definition from Merriam-Webster:

#### propaganda 

>noun
>
>
>pro·​pa·​gan·​da
>
>
>1 capitalized: a congregation of the Roman curia having jurisdiction over missionary territories and related institutions
>
>2: the spreading of ideas, information, or rumor for the purpose of helping or injuring an institution, a cause, or a person
>
>3: ideas, facts, or allegations spread deliberately to further one's cause or to damage an opposing cause also : a public action having such an effect


It's really kind of hard to say what propaganda is in the twenty-first century.
With so many independent voices disseminating information to micro audiences there has never been such a fracturing of the information stream in a modern society.
Because of the impossibility of verifying everything said by every disseminator of information
&mdash;
whether the platform be podcasting,
blogging,
or independently maintained news sites with a very deliberately stated bias,
like Christian news
&mdash;
we are living in an age of pure propaganda.
Micro agendas are inching into the public space.
No longer are we the nation that rallied together in the early part of the twentieth century,
twice no less.
We are now a series of barely interlinked igloos sitting out the Arctic night for six months,
occasionally crossing paths when necessity require us both to be out and about,
you know,
like foraging for food?


One of the best recent examples of useful propaganda was Pearl Harbor.
The United States and crack the Japanese code six months or more before the attack on Pearl Harbor.
They knew what was coming.
The people of Pearl Harbor were never warned and no preparations in defense of an imminent attack were ever made.
The government of the United States of America did nothing to propel America into war,
but,
at the same time,
they did nothing to keep America out of the war when the latter was an achievable goal.
Right around the time that the truth of Pearl Harbor was breaking in American consciousness,
due to the lifting of the 50-year classified status on all materials related to Pearl Harbor in the possession of the US government,
and it was revealed through academic distillation that in fact the United States did know about the attack and failed to warn the American people,
and further,
these same academics hypothecated that the reason was to create the emotional equity,
via outrage,
to embolden the American people to demand they enter the war.
It was an absolutely perfect piece of propaganda executed by the United States government on the United States people.


At the same time that the hardcover copies of the Ivy League creative nonfiction were coming out at Barnes & Nobles
&mdash;
remember book stores?
&mdash;

with the truth a Pearl Harbor,
Hollywood threw Ben Affleck into a little film called Pearl Harbor and retold the old sneak attack story.
Twenty years after the official declassification of the truth of Pearl Harbor most Americans still believe it was a sneak attack.
The truth is out there,
but if nobody is telling it to you,
straight to your face,
like Ben Affleck on the big screen,
then maybe it never happened,
no matter what the doctors of history had to say about it.
Tell people the horrible truth,
then provide an emotionally convenient counter story.
Reality is tough.
They know you want to live in a comfortable place.

Ben Affleck or:

>In Day of Deceit, Robert Stinnett delivers the definitive final chapter on America's greatest secret and our worst military disaster.

>Drawing on twenty years of research and access to scores of previously classified documents, Stinnett proves that Pearl Harbor was not an accident, a mere failure of American intelligence, or a brilliant Japanese military coup. By showing that ample warning of the attack was on FDR's desk and, furthermore, that a plan to push Japan into war was initiated at the highest levels of the U.S. government, he ends up profoundly altering our understanding of one of the most significant events in American history.

They sacrificed three thousand people for the emotional equity to invest in World War II.
Ben Affleck.
Sneak attack.
You never really had a choice.
They've studied the way with you think.
Everybody chooses honey.
Nobody chooses vinegar.
There's no moral reasoning to it.
It's natural. 
It is what it is.
And so it goes with the light narrative.
Only what persists in light survives,
so we lose part of the truth.
